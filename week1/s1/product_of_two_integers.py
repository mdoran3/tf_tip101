# Template Questions
### U - Understand 
# 1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
    # How many params does the func take?
    # What data types are the params?
    # What arithmetic operation should e use?

### P - Plan
# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do: 
    # Write a func that takes to int params
    # return the product of the two params
# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
    # func(var1, var2) - two params
    #   return var1 * var2


### I - Implement
# 4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:
def product(a, b):
    return a * b

print(product(22, 7))
