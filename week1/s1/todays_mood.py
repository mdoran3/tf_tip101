# Template Questions
### U - Understand 
    # What params does the function take?
    # How many variables should be used in the function?

### P - Plan
# 2. Write out in plain English what you want to do: 
    # Write a function without any params and then create a variable called mood
    # Pass that variable into the print statement and concatenate it with the string "Today's mood: "
# 3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
    # function() - no params
    #   mood = "🥱"
    #   print "Today's mood: " + mood


### I - Implement
# 4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:
def todays_mood():
    mood = "🥱"
    print("Today's mood: " + mood)
todays_mood()
